This React Native bug is related to unexpected behavior when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex item rendering.  The issue manifests as random crashes or freezes, especially on lower-end devices. The root cause is often related to inefficient rendering or memory management within the `renderItem` function, leading to dropped frames and eventually application termination.  The following code snippet demonstrates a simplified example of a `FlatList` in React Native, but this particular piece of code isn't directly causing the crash. The problem often hides in the complexity of the component within `renderItem`.
